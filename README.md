# AIT-664---Hands-on-II

For this project, I used the Boston Housing Dataset. This dataset includes information on various features of houses in Boston, such as crime rate, property tax, average number of rooms, and the proximity to the Charles River. The target variable for regression is the Median House Value (in $1000s), and for classification, I categorized houses based on whether their price is above or below the median price of all houses in the dataset.

Features:
Crime_Rate: Crime rate per capita.
Avg_Rooms_Per_Dwelling: Average number of rooms per dwelling.
Distance_to_Employment_Centers: Weighted distances to employment centers in Boston.

In this project, I explored the Boston Housing dataset to predict house prices and classify them based on the median price. Using both regression and classification models, I found that Random Forest models performed the best for both tasks, accurately capturing complex patterns in the data. Linear and Logistic Regression models provided useful baselines but were outperformed by Random Forest due to its ability to handle non-linear relationships. Overall, this analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of ensemble models in predicting and classifying house prices, and it highlights the potential of machine learning in real estate valuation.
